        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>No need for takeout from your local Thai restaurant when you can make an authentic-tasting curry this good in 25 minutes at home. The curry is hearty yet healthy comfort food that’s layered with Thai-inspired flavors and is naturally gluten-free.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2 tablespoons salted butter</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons yellow curry paste</li>
            <li>1 (14 ounce) can coconut milk</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
            <li>1 large yellow onion, sliced</li>
            <li>5 cloves garlic, diced</li>
            <li>1 pound skinless, boneless chicken breast, cut into 1-inch cubes</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon chicken soup base (such as Better than Bouillon®)</li>
            <li>½ cup lightly salted cashews</li>
            <li>1⅓ cups water</li>
            <li>1 cup uncooked jasmine rice, rinsed and drained</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Steps</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Gently melt butter in a large skillet over low heat. Add curry paste; cook and stir for 2 to 3 minutes. Stir in coconut milk and bring to a simmer.</li>
            <li>Heat olive oil in a separate skillet over medium heat; stir in onion and garlic. Saute until onion has softened and turned translucent, about 5 minutes. Add chicken and chicken base and cook for 4 to 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Transfer chicken mixture into the coconut-curry sauce. Cover and simmer, stirring occasionally, for 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, combine water and rice in a saucepan. Cover and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low and simmer until all water has been absorbed, about 9 minutes. Turn off the heat and let rice sit, covered, for 10 to 15 minutes. Uncover and fluff with a fork.</li>
            <li>Serve chicken curry over rice. Garnish with cashews just before serving.</li>
        </ol>
